# Results & Visualization
After running the Genetic Algorithm, two result files are generated in the results/ folder:

 - Fitness Progress Graph (fitness_graph.png)
 This graph illustrates how the fitness score evolves over generations.

It helps track the improvement of solutions over time.
A well-performing algorithm should show a steady or rapid increase in fitness.
 - Optimization Result (optimization_result.png)
 This image visualizes the final optimized node placements after running the algorithm.

It provides insight into how the Genetic Algorithm arranges nodes efficiently.
The final solution is the best configuration found based on the given parameters.
