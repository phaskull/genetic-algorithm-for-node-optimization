#  Source Code (`src/`)

This folder contains the core implementation of the **Genetic Algorithm for Node Optimization**.

##  Contents

- **`ga.py`** → Implements the Genetic Algorithm logic.
- **`utils.py`** → Contains helper functions (e.g., loading configuration files).
- **`config.yaml`** → Stores algorithm parameters such as population size, mutation rate, and generations.

##  How It Works?
1. `ga.py` initializes a population and evolves solutions using selection, crossover, and mutation.
2. `utils.py` loads configuration settings from `config.yaml`.
3. The algorithm runs iteratively and outputs results in the `results/` directory.
